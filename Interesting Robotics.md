Interesting Robotics
--------------------

Interesting things not yet on the awesome list or no longer actively developed.

- [keras-finetuning](https://github.com/danielvarga/keras-finetuning) - Fine-tune InceptionV3 on your own data and try out on a webcam, plus use apple photos for labeling.
- [Teaching Robotics with a Simulator](https://github.com/ULgRobotics/trs) - TRS: An Open-source Recipe for Teaching/Learning Robotics with the V-REP Simulator.
- [dataset_loaders](https://github.com/fvisin/dataset_loaders) - Load a variety of video and segmentation datasets in python for machine learning.
- [ros-tag-tracking](https://github.com/ablarry91/ros-tag-tracking) - Evaluates three different ROS tag tracking packages.
- [gym-gazebo](https://github.com/erlerobot/gym-gazebo) - Simulator for reinforcement learning algorithms using ROS and Gazebo.
- [neuralnets](https://github.com/mzaradzki/neuralnets) - Deep Learning libraries tested on images and time series, keras, theano, tensorflow.
- [OpenSurfaces](https://github.com/seanbell/opensurfaces) - Crowdsourcing pipeline and website for OpenSurfaces [SIG '13] and Intrinsic Images in the Wild [SIG '14].
- [G3DB](https://uwaterloo.ca/neurorobotics-lab/g3db) - Simulated grasping dataset.
- [MIME dataset](https://sites.google.com/view/mimedataset/people?authuser=0) - 8k+ human and robot tasks recorded, but no license saying what you can do with it and only an overview readme, no detailed documentation... maybe it will improve eventually?
